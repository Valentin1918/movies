# Roadmap (ideas for future):

* Visual UI improvements:
> Add a stub image to replace a MoviesList if there are no movies;

> Add a stub image on MovieListItem to use it as background if backdrop_path is undefined;

> Add a stub image on MovieModal to display it if poster_path is undefined;

> Use three points (...) to cut extra movie title or description

* Performance improvements:
> Move caching images in Web or Service Worked or window.requestIdleCallback
